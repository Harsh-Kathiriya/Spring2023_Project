for the credentials class, the file reads in a series of 4 files that contain credential ids that contain 9 digits.
These 4 lists are seperated into 4 different types of user credentials. When an object is created, it reads in the files,
creates 4 seperate array lists of the credentials that can be iterated through to assess if the user type is valid.
